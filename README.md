# How to Install:
1. Click on the "<> Code" button and choose "Download ZIP"
2. Go to your Arduino sketches folder.
3. If you don't have a folder called `libraries` in there, create one.
4. Extract the .zip file into your libraries folder. Your folder structure should look like:
   - Arduino
     - libraries
       - arduino-mat-graphics-main
5. In order to use the library in your sketches add `#include <LED_Matrix_Graphics.h>` at thetop of your code
